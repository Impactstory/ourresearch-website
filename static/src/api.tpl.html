    <h1>API and datasets</h1>


     <p>
        There are are two main ways to access oaDOI's data: the API and the datasets.

     </p>
    <p>
         The API is much easier to use, so it's probably your best bet.
        Most applications will not have scale problems using the
         API, as it can handle 100k/day from your application, and average return time is <200ms.
        The datasets are quite large (90M and 19M rows) and so using them requires some extra work, but
        they are great for some large research projects. The API is free for both commercial
        and noncommercial use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whichever you're using, we recommend you subscribe to the
        <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/oadoi-users">mailing list</a> in order
        to stay up-to-date when there are changes or new features.
    </p>

    <h2>API Version 1</h2>
    <p>
        This is currently the default version; however <a href="api/v2">v2</a> will become the default
        on October 1, 2017, so we recommend new users build on v2. <a href="/api/v1">Read the v1 documentation here.</a>
    </p>

    <h2>API Version 2</h2>
    <p>
        Version 2 will become the default version on October 1, 2017, and we recommend that new users build on this version. <a href="/api/v2">Read the v2 documentation here.</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Datasets</h2>
    <p>
        The datasets behind the oaDOI API are available for download as two big CSV files.
        They are free for use in
        non-commercial academic research.
        <a href="mailto:team@impactstory.org">Contact us</a> if you're interested in downloading them.
