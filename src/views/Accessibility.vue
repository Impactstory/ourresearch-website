                In order to provide excellent service to all of our users, including those with disabilities, the Our Research websites, products, and services aim to provide an accessible experience for users of all abilities. Our Research has developed our websites and products with accessibility in mind. This Accessibility Statement applies to these tools and websites:
            </p>
        <ul style="margin: 10px 0px 30px 30px;">
            <li><a href="https://unsub.org">unsub.org</a></li>
            <li> <a href="https://unpaywall.org">unpaywall.org</a></li>

            <li>Other websites and tools created and hosted by Our Research</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Conformance status</h2>

            <p>
Our improvements are guided by relevant portions of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, Level AA and other recommendations. We have included accessibility features such as: navigability without use of a keyboard, text alternatives for non-text content, and assigned language for web pages. Our Research websites are partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA. Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.
            </p>
        <p>
            If you have questions or concerns about the accessibility of our websites, tools, or services, please contact us by sending an email to team@ourresearch.org. Please provide specific details about the accessibility issue, including the web address that may have caused challenges.
